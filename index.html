<h3>Only use E85 Flex Fuel if your car is prepared!</h3>
<p>E85 Flex Fuel is a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gas that CANNOT be used in every engine! Make sure you have a FlexFuel car before even thinking about purchasing E85. Many manufacturers use yellow gas caps to signify that E85 is permitted, but this may be different by country/region/etc.
</p>

<h3>What to do if the prices are similar?</h3>
<p>
You have 2 choices if the price at the pump is within pennies of the calculated best price.
<ol><li>Buy non-ethanol to receive the most miles for your tank of gas, reducing your number of trips back to the gas station.</li>
<li>Go Green and buy gas with ethanol to reduce your usage of fossil fuels (oil).</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
Ethanol reduces your miles per gallon (mpg) compared to gasoline that contains no ethanol, based on the energy output of ethanol vs gasoline.
This calculator allows for comparison based on price per gallon of gas.
</p>
<p>
For example, if normal non-ethanol gas is $3.499, then E85 is only worth it when less than $2.482;
E15 when less than $3.319;
and E10 when less than $3.379.
</p> 

<h3>Octane Explained</h3>
<p>
If you're like me, then you might not know that higher Octane is not better for your car even though it is more expensive!
Buy the lowest Octane that your car is rated for. Anything higher will not hurt your car but also will not help your car, so you would probably be wasting money.
Most US cars take 87 octane, except for luxury brands like Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes, etc that often require 91 octane. (or 85 and 89 respectively in high altitude Mountain areas)
</p>

<h3>Your Mileage May Vary</h3>
<p>
GasChooser calculations are purely informational and economical. Other online resources show the pros/cons of ethanol effects on your engine, along with additional environmental benefits, or even the political effects of ethanol subsidies. Your actual miles per gallon may vary slightly from this generic calculation.
</p>
<p>
Even though this calculator is displayed in US-dollars, the calculation is the same for any currency. Just ignore the dollar sign and the results are fine if you are trying this calculation in Mexico, Canada, Europe, etc...
